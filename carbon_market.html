            <p class="text">
                The Colon Night Market is a program that was started by former Mayor Mike Rama in 2007. 
                It was designed to bring back the old glory of the country’s oldest street, Colon Street, 
                established in 1565. (The street was named after explorer Christopher Columbus’s Spanish name, 
                Cristóbal Colón) Night Market in Carbon has provided Cebuano entrepreneurs an avenue to reach more customers, supporting the recovery of business activity in Cebu City amid pandemic.
                The weekly night market, which has become a new attraction since it soft opened late last month, was officially launched on Sunday night, April 22.
                Speaking during the launch, Cebu City Mayor Michael Rama reiterated his support to the modernization of the city’s biggest public market, saying that this project will significantly improve the lives of the vendors.
                The event was graced by other city officials and executives from Megawide, the firm behind the market’s redevelopment project.
                According to Rama, he would continue to support the Carbon modernization works as long as he remains the city’s mayor.
                Appealing to the Carbon community to also support the project, Rama said its “aim is really to improve the condition of the traders in Carbon” and provide a better place for the Cebuanos.
                Mayor Rama acknowledged Megawide subsidiary Cebu2World Development Inc., the firm undertaking the project, for already bringing major developments to Carbon since it started the project just last year.
                The private company has already finished the construction of the Interim Market which will temporarily house Carbon vendors for two years while their permanent market is being constructed.
                It has also improved the stalls of ambulant vendors, who are now trading at a much cleaner and a new facility called the “Bagsakan” market.
                Meanwhile, Cebu2World has conceptualized the Sunday Market to provide Carbon vendors and other small entrepreneurs an avenue, where they can earn more.
                The weekly night market has been attracting huge foot traffic, giving much potential income to these traders.
                The trade fair features various stalls selling different kinds of food, delicacies, locally made products, and other merchandise.
                It aims to attract both locals and tourists, preserve the Cebuano culinary culture, and boost the vibrancy of the Carbon community as a whole.
